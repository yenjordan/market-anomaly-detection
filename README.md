## Overview
The Market Anomaly Detection Platform is a web app designed to help users detect and analyze anomalies in time-series data. It's built with a user-friendly interface and powerful tools for data scientists and analysts. The platform currently includes 225 trained models, with 117 actively used in production. These models are built using 9 different ML algorithms across 25 detection strategies to provide reliable anomaly detection for various data patterns.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 22+
- npm or yarn

### Model Training Environment Setup
1. Create a Python virtual environment in the `anomaly_models` directory:
```bash
cd anomaly_models
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Unix/MacOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `anomaly_models` directory with your API keys:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
DEFAULT_MODEL=your_model_name
```

### Frontend + Backend Setup
1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure the environment:
Modify the `.env` file in the root directory to set your desired ports:
```env
BACKEND_PORT=3000
FRONTEND_PORT=5174
```

The Vite proxy will automatically use these port configurations.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
Run frontend and backend separately:
```bash
# Frontend
npm run dev:frontend

# Backend
npm run dev:backend
```

Or run both concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
